This repository is a record of the projects and learning material of Leo Wei from Duke University's ECE 551 Autumn 2025.
In this course we focused on the fundamentals of C and C++, including but not limited to Pointer Manipulation, RAII, Inheritance, etc.
Among the courseworks there are 3 projects:
* Rocket Flight Path Calulation Simulator: A program designed to, given a list of source planets and destination planets, calculate the correct launch angle and time it takes for the rocket to reach the destination planet.
  * Fully built using C
  * Required I/O handing and proper error checking, along with pointer manipulation
  * Ensured proper memory allocation and deallocation
* Psuedo Mad Lib Generator
