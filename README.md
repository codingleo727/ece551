# ECE 551: Systems Programming & Data Structures

**Author:** Leo Wei | Duke University (Autumn 2025)

A comprehensive collection of systems programming projects focused on memory management, algorithm design, and object-oriented architecture in C and C++.

## Core Competencies
* **Languages:** C, C++
* **Concepts:** Pointer Arithmetic, RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), Inheritance & Polymorphism, Dynamic Memory Management.
* **Data Structures:** Binary Search Trees (BST), Linked Lists, Custom Parsers.

## Key Projects

### 1. Cargo Loading Simulator (C++)
*An object-oriented logistics engine that optimizes cargo allocation for shipping fleets.*
* **Architecture:** Designed a polymorphic class hierarchy to abstract different ship and cargo types.
* **Optimization:** Implemented a Binary Search Tree (BST) to algorithmically determine the most efficient use of cargo capacity.
* **Technical Focus:** Utilized C++ inheritance and encapsulation to maintain clean, modular code.

### 2. Rocket Trajectory Calculator (C)
*A physics-based simulation tool for calculating orbital launch parameters.*
* **Functionality:** Computes optimal launch angles and flight durations given variable source and destination planets.
* **Reliability:** Implemented robust input validation and error handling to manage edge cases in user data.
* **Technical Focus:** Applied complex pointer manipulation to handle large datasets of planetary coordinates.

### 3. Dynamic Story Generator (C)
*A "Mad Libs" style text generation engine capable of parsing and assembling complex narrative structures.*
* **Memory Management:** Manually managed dynamic memory allocation (malloc/free) to handle arbitrary text lengths without memory leaks.
* **Parsing:** developed a custom file parser to merge template stories with user-provided word lists.
* **Technical Focus:** Low-level string manipulation and defensive programming practices.
