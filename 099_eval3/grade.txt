 With arguments 
 inputs/ships0.txt 
-------------------------
I need to compile your code for ships-step1 (make ships-step1)

Compiling ships-step1
g++ -c -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -pedantic --std=gnu++03 route.cpp
g++ -c -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -pedantic --std=gnu++03 ship.cpp

You have already pass the basic tests for step1:
**step1 basic tests passed for ldw59 at 1763351308** : 819dc323e3b7b641a36627aae3c52e64c144e9f8  -
You have PASSED all of your test cases
Keep adding test cases until you are satisfied your program is correct
