========================================
For implementation, you earned 63 /  68
--------------------------------
Code quality was graded by: Haochen
Your TA graded this based on use of C++03
Please ask them if you have any questions:
------------------------------------------
 * Classes are nouns: Always (>90%)
 * Methods are verbs: Always (>90%)
 * Good Use of Has-A: Always (>90%)
 * Good Use of IS-A: Always (>90%)
 * Uses references (avoids needless copies): Always (>90%)
 * Follows Rule of 3: Always (>90%)
 * Good use of public/private: Always (>90%)
 * const correct: Always (>90%)
 * Good use of STL (vector, set, map): Always (>90%)
 * Avoids Duplicating Code Between Container and Tanker: Some
 * Uses subtype polymorphism + dynamic dispatch (as opposed to if-else on type of ship): Yes
 * Step 4: Find fitting ship efficiently: O(N)
 * Find method is generic: N/A
Your TA wrote the following comments:
It's a great idea to think how to reduce duplicated code in ContainerShip and TankerShip; You are doing a linear search on the AVLTree which does not make full use of the data structure

For quality, you earned 27.2 / 32 points
